Please provide the input you want me to insert. I need the text you want me to incorporate into the outline. 

For example, you could provide:

* **Specific details about the planet Koal:**  "Koal is a harsh desert planet with a rich history of rebellion against the Empire. Its population is mostly made up of nomadic tribes who rely on scavenging for survival."
* **Information about Sergeant Brillian's past:** "Sergeant Brillian is a decorated veteran of the Imperial army, but he is haunted by the memories of a past mission where he was forced to kill civilians. This experience has left him disillusioned with the Empire and questioning his loyalty."
* **A new plot twist:** "The Architect is not who they seem. They are actually a former Imperial scientist who developed a new technology that allows them to manipulate the minds of others."

Once you give me the text, I can insert it into the outline and revise it to make sure it fits well with the overall story.
